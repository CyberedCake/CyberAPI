**Is your feature request related to a problem?**
If your feature is related to a problem (this doesn't work, this is broken, this sends an error, etc.), please create a bug report instead! Include "NO" here if you are sure it is not related to a problem, and if the answer is "YES", cancel this issue.

**Describe Your Feature**
Describe the feature you would like and how you would like it to work. This should be clearly understandable as some of it may be used in the javadoc. 

**Describe Alternatives You've Considered** (optional)
Are there any other round-a-bout alternatives or just obvious alternates you can think of? If so, please describe why we shouldn't just use that alternative instead of creating a new feature for it. If no, please leave this field blank.

**Describe Feature Type** (optional)
What type of feature are you proposing? Quality of Life (QoL), feature addition, feature removal in favor of another, a new feature altogether, or other.

**Additional Comments or Context** (optional)
Add any other comments, context, screenshots, or anything else to this field.
